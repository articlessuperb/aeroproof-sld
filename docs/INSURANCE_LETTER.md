# 🛡️ Disclosure of Automated Risk Mitigation Protocols
**To:** Insurance Underwriting & Risk Management Department  
**From:** Róisín Mary Murtagh, Director  
**Organization:** South London Drones Ltd  
**Date:** February 6, 2026

### 📑 Subject: Deployment of AeroProof Enterprise for Airspace Command

This document serves as a formal disclosure regarding the enhanced safety and compliance architecture now operational at **South London Drones Ltd**. To mitigate the risks associated with urban drone operations (specifically in high-density areas like Croydon and Sutton), we have implemented the **AeroProof Enterprise** suite.

#### 1. Removal of Human Error (Formal Logic Gates)
Our flight authorization workflow is now governed by **Formal Logic Verification**. Our Director-level dashboard pulls live meteorological data and enforces strict safety theorems:
* **Wind Thresholds:** Automatic grounding if $v \geq 20 \text{ kts}$.
* **Visibility Thresholds:** Automatic grounding if $s \leq 5000 \text{ m}$.
* **Precipitation:** Zero-tolerance logic—missions are aborted if the Rain Radar API detects any moisture.

#### 2. Enhanced Airspace Awareness (RID Radar)
In alignment with 2026 UK Electronic Conspicuity mandates, our system integrates a **Visual Airspace Radar**. This allows the Director to distinguish our "Friendly" fleet aircraft from "Unknown" intruders via **Direct Remote ID (RID)** in real-time, significantly reducing the probability of mid-air collisions.

#### 3. Verification Audit Logs
Every pre-flight check generates an immutable **Compliance Certificate**. This creates a transparent audit trail of our safety decisions, providing evidentiary support that all missions are conducted within the "Gold Standard" safety envelope.

### ⚖️ Underwriting Impact
We believe these technological safeguards represent a substantial reduction in operational liability. We request that these protocols be factored into our next risk assessment and premium calculation.

**Signed,**

*Róisín Murtagh* Director, South London Drones Ltd
